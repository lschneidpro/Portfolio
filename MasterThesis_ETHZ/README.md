## *Revisiting Equity Strategies with Financial Machine Learning*

## Description
This is a Master Thesis as part of the [Msc Management, Technology and Economics](https://mtec.ethz.ch/studies.html) at ETH, Zurich,Switzerland, where I designed profitable Equity strategies with Financial Machine Learning and Data Science techniques. It has been supervised by [Prof. Dr. Didier Sornette](https://er.ethz.ch/about-us/people/sornette.html) from the [Chair of Entrepreneurial Risks](https://er.ethz.ch).

## Abstract
With the recent trend around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, these techniques have been widely used by academics and practitioners to forecast financial markets. With the most modern concepts of financial machine learning and data science, this paper attempt to derive a sustainable and interpretable Equity strategy with common Equity strategies signals as input. This paper also reviews numerous challenges and issues encountered in financial machine learning application as early modelling have been compromised by data leakage despite cautious procedures. After remedying it, the strategies proposed remain profitable and still beats the Russell 1000 Index, including transaction costs.
