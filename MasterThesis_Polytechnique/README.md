## *The Impact of the Australian Carbon Tax on Wholesale Spot Electricity Prices*

## Description
This is a Master Thesis as part of the [Msc Sciences for Environmental Challenges](https://www.coriolis.polytechnique.fr/MASTERS/SEC.html) at Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France where I designed an index to measure the Impact of the Australian carbon tax on wholesale spot electricity prices. It has been supervised by [Prof. Dr. Stefan Trueck](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/stefan-trueck) from the [Centre for Financial Risk, Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/prosperous-economies/centres/centre-for-risk-analytics), Sydney, Australia.

Matlab codes and data available upon request.

## Abstract
This research internship aims to study the impact of the carbon tax on the wholesale electricity spot price within the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). While the majority of previous studies have been performed using theoretical and simulation methods before the tax implementation, this study uses empirical methods based on data from January 2009 to June 2015. Results shows that the carbon tax would be fully passed in the wholesale electricity spot prices meaning that final consumers bear the cost of the tax while it reveals being a potential windfall profit for electricity generators even after its revocation the 1st July of 2014.
