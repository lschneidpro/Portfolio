[Link to Webapp](https://bertsentiment-app.herokuapp.com)

## Description
This is a personal web development project as part of the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). The project consists of deploying a sentiment analysis model trained on the [IMDb Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). 

### Initial Project: LSTM with Amazon SageMaker
In the first project, we trained an deployed an LSTM model with AmazonSagemaker. The test set accuracy is around 84% and the web app looks like as follows:

### Enhanced Project: DistilBERT with Dash on Heroku
In this enhanced project, the following improvement are poposed:
* Better web app appearance with Dash and Bootstrap
* Computation of confidence scores displayed by a gauge
* Model performance increase with DistilBERT (around 93% accuracy on test set)
