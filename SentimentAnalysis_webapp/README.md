## Description of the specialization
In this Professional Certificate I developed and honed hands-on skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. I started with an orientation of Data Science and its methodologies, became familiar and used a variety of data science tools, learned Python and SQL, performed Data Visualization and Analysis, and created Machine Learning models. In the process I completed several labs and assignments on the IBM cloud including a Capstone Project at the end to apply and demonstrate my knowledge and skills.
