## Description
This is a personal web development project as part of the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).

It is a flask app that visualizes data in preparation of a trip to Greece during Summer 2020.
We monitor in particular the [criteria](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/empfehlungen-fuer-reisende/quarantaene-einreisende.html) for a country to be considered risky by the Swiss government as it could lead to quarantine upon return.

Data is pulled directly from the following APIs and then visualized using Plotly:
* [weather widget](https://weatherwidget.io)
* [about-corona API](https://greece-travel-2020.herokuapp.com)
