# Predict Customer Churn

 **Predict Customer Churn** Project from the ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree of Udacity

## Project Description
This is a project to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, logs and tested).

The code is expected to run unit tests and to generate logs, images and model files.
The code can be run locally as follows:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```

The code can be run as a container as follows:
```console
docker build . -t app
docker run -it app
```
