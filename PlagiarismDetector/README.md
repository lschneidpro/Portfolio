# Plagiarism Detector

## Description
This is a personal web development project as part of the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). The project consists of building and deploying a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text. The model is trained with [Corpus of Plagiarised Short Answers](https://ir.shef.ac.uk/cloughie/resources/plagiarism_corpus.html).

### Initial Project: SVM with Amazon SageMaker
In the initial project, we trained an deployed an SVM model with AmazonSagemaker. The test set accuracy is around 95%.

### Enhanced Project: Webapp on Heroku
In progress
